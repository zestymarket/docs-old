You'll received a MetaMask pop-up notification when the transaction is done. The other way to check is to go to your Campaigns page and you'll see the campaign you've created listed on the page.

Now that you have your Campaign set-up, you're ready to start bidding on the timeslot of the creator of your choice.

## 2. Bid timeslot

First you'll need to go to the **Market** page. On the page, you'll be able to see all the spaces that have been created by the creators, ready for you to bid on. **Choose** the space you desire, for the purpose of this guide, we'll choose Zesty Ad Demo space.

On top of the Space page, you'll see the cover image, details and description of the Space. The Auction and History section can be found at the bottom of the page. Auction shows you the slots available for bidding and History shows the historical campaigns and prices of the Space.

To start bidding on the Space, click on the timeslot you want. The selected timeslot will be highlighted in blue. You may bid on more than 1 timeslots. When you're ready, you can click on the shopping cart icon to  checkout.

Select Campaign pop-up will appear for you to choose the Campaign you want to advertise. Select the campaign you want to use. And click **Next**.

Next, you'll see a Review Order pop-up. Here you'll need to click **Approve** to allow Zesty Market to spend your USDC, and **Submit**, to submit the order.

On both actions, you'll be greeted with MetaMask pop-ups. Both will require a small amount of gas fees. Click on confirm on both occasions.

Once the you've confirmed the submission of the order, your bid will appear on the Auction section of the Space. The status will be seen as "Awaiting Approval" until the creator of the Space accepts your bid! If they accept, your campaign will appear in their space for the time specified in the auction.

## 3. Refunds

If the advertisement was not successfully displayed you will be refunded a majority of your USDC, though some USDC will be taken by the network for fees.

This fee is also meant to discourage malicious advertisers from repeatedly putting campaigns that publishers do not desire, effectively causing a denial of service for the publisher. The fees will make the denial of service expensive for a malicious advertiser.
