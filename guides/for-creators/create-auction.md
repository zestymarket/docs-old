## 3. Create auction

From the [Space](https://app.zesty.market/spaces) page, select the Space you want to create an auction with.

In the Space page, you'll find **Deposit NFT** button, click on it.

A deposit NFT pop-up will appear. There are 2 actions you are required to do here, **Approve** and **Deposit**. You'll need to do each of the action one-by-one. Both of the buttons will result in MetaMask pop-ups requiring you to confirm your actions.
