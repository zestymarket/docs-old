## Wonderland Engine

#### Step 1a

To just use the bundled file, download it by right-clicking this link and saving it into your project folder: [https://ipfs.io/ipns/lib.zesty.market/zesty-wonderland-sdk.js](https://ipfs.io/ipns/lib.zesty.market/zesty-wonderland-sdk.js)

#### Step 1b

If you are using NPM in your Wonderland project, install it like so:

```
npm install '@zestymarket/wonderland-sdk'
```

**Warning**: Make sure you are using the same three.js version as the Zesty package. You can check here: [https://github.com/zestymarket/sdk/blob/main/wonderland/package.json](https://github.com/zestymarket/sdk/blob/main/wonderland/package.json)

#### Step 2

In your Wonderland project, open your Project Settings view and make sure that the SDK is being included in your JavaScript source paths.
