## Before You Integrate

You will first need to create a Space NFT in order to get started checkout "For Creators" for more instructions.

## Instructions

#### Create an image

Add an 'image from URL' to your Cryptovoxels parcel.

#### Configure Image

**Step 1**

Set the scale of the image to correspond with your space's format. For reference, the aspect ratios on each format are:

* Tall - 3:4
* Wide - 4:1
* Square - 1:1

Change the Blend mode from Multiply to Combine, unless you would like the image to be affected by lighting.

**Step 2**

Set the Transparency mode to Alpha Blended.

**Step 3**

Under Display, make sure Stretch is checked.

#### Add the script

In the Script section, copy and paste the script located here:

[https://github.com/zestymarket/sdk/blob/main/cryptovoxels/integration.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zestymarket/sdk/main/cryptovoxels/integration.js)

**At the end of the script**, copy this line to call the loadBanner function (modify according to your own space information):

```
loadBanner('0', '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'polygon', 'tall', 'standard');
```

Replace `0` and  `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with your space number and wallet address

You can also pass the argument `true` if you would like to opt into Zesty Analytics. Anyone will be able to view this on your Space's page, where it will display a history of visits to your space and clicks on your banner.

Adding a banner to the previous example would look like this:

```
loadBanner('0', '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', 'polygon', 'tall', 'standard', true)
```
