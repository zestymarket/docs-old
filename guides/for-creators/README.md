## 3. Create auction

From the [Space](https://app.zesty.market/spaces) page, select the Space you want to create an auction with.

In the Space page, you'll find **Deposit NFT** button, click on it.

A deposit NFT pop-up will appear. There are 2 actions you are required to do here, **Approve** and **Deposit**. You'll need to do each of the action one-by-one. Both of the buttons will result in MetaMask pop-ups requiring you to confirm your actions.

Below are the Confirmations you'll need to do when Approving and Depositing your NFT.

![Left: Approving Zesty to spend your USDC. Right: Confirming to deposit your NFT](../../.gitbook/assets/Space\_6.png)

On both occasions, you'll get a notification when the transaction is completed.

Next, click on **Create Auction** under the Auctions section. The Auction calendar will pop-up. Then, choose your date for the auction slot, set the amount of auction in USDC, and click on **Confirm**.
