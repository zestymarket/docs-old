## 1. Creating a Space

### **Connect your wallet**

Go to [https://www.zesty.market/](https://www.zesty.market) and click on **Launch App**.

Before doing anything, you will need to switch to the Polygon Network in your wallet. If you are using MetaMask, the network selection menu will look like this:

If Polygon (or Matic) is not in your Network list, you will either need to [manually add the RPC](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/network-details/network/) or connect to a Polygon based dApp like [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) which will automate the process for you.
