# Decentraland Integration

**Step 1**

Download the latest release of the Zesty Banner smart item (it will be the first file listed named "item.zip"), which you can find in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/zestymarket/dcl/releases).

**Step 2**

Open your scene in the Decentraland Builder, then click the + sign next to "Asset Packs". When prompted, drag the item.zip folder you downloaded previously into the indicated area. Follow the prompts, then click "Save Asset Pack". You now have the custom Zesty Banner smart item available to use!

**Step 3**

Open your new asset pack and click the Zesty Banner smart item to spawn it into the scene. Click on the banner to adjust the various settings such as network, space ID, format, style, and beacon usage.
